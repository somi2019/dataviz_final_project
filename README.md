The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course in Fall 2020.It includes 3 project,in the first mini project some analysis was done on the **World Cup Matches** data series.The second one was an analysis of **Marathon Result 2017** and finally two short analysis on **Tampa Weather** from *2016 to 2017* and *BB_top100_2015*.In these 3 projects it was required to help from a variety of functions and skills which was taught during this course.Following a brief summary of all these project could be seen:


## Project 01


## Data Visualization Course Project

## **WorldCupMatches**

For this mini project I worked on world cup matches dataset, which includes matches during **1930 to 2014** held in different cities between different teams I focouced on some of variables mainly like *Home team goals*, *away team goals*, *audience* and some other variable to be used was created for this report such as *total goals*.

## Findings:

*	For audiences between 70,000 to 150,000 Number of attendance in cities like **London** and **Mexico City** and **Los Angeles** were the most in home town matches.

*	For More than **50,000** attendance Teams of **Brazil** and **Mexico** had most audiences in home town matches.

*	For audiences more than **90,000** for games with 2 goals there were the most attendances in **Rio De Janiro**.Also in **Netherland** match there were fewest attendance to watch the game.




## Project 02

## **marathon result 2017**

![Marathon 2017 ](https://i2.wp.com/greenpointers.com/app/uploads/2018/11/nyc-marathon.jpg?w=705&ssl=1)


This *mini project* will review marathon result dataset in different countries in 2017,with some main variables such as gender,age,overal ranking,city,country which I worked on them mainly also some other variable to be used created for this report such as finishing time.

In above map 3 first most popluted runneres countries are shown:*USA,Canada,United Kingdom*.

## Findings:

* The *youngest female* finishers were **18** years old, and *oldest female* ones were **84** years old.

* *youngest male* finishers were **18** years old and *oldest male* runners were **83** years old.

* Women are more eager to marathon when they are younger,specially when they are **25** and again when they are around **40**,but as they becoe older,they lose eagerness to run.

* Men become interested to marathon slow by slow when they become older,specifically when they become **40,45,50** they love to join marathon races.after turning to **50** always more number of men are interested to run compare to women.

* *Female* runnersare younger than *male* runners in first quartile, median and third quartile.Median for women is at their **40** but for men is at their **45**.


## Project 03
In this exercise you will explore methods to visualize text data and practice how to recreate charts that show the distributions of a continuous variable. 


## Part 1: Density Plots

Using the dataset obtained from FSU's, for a station at Tampa International Airport (TPA) from 2016 to 2017.

## Part 2: Visualizing Text Data

for this section *BB_top100_2015* data set was selected.
