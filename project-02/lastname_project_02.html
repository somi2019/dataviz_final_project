# Mini Project(**marathon result 2017**)
---
This *mini project* will review marathon result dataset in different countries in 2017,with some main variables such as gender,age,overal ranking,city,country which I worked on them mainly also some other variable to be used created for this report such as finishing time.
Here I listed some *main steps* to start working on this dataset:

**Step 1**: Using the function read_csv() to read and variables are assigned for further use.

**Step 2**: Checking and omitting missed data.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
marathon_2017<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reisanar/datasets/master/marathon_results_2017.csv")
```

Give an overview on data by *head* command:

```{r cars}
head(marathon_2017)
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
colSums(is.na(marathon_2017))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
!colSums(is.na(marathon_2017))
```


To have a demoghraphy from runners I applied *summary* comand:
```{r}
by(marathon_2017$Age, marathon_2017$M.F, summary)

```

The *youngest female* finishers were 18 years old, and *oldest female* ones were 84, also *youngest male* finishers were 18 years old and *oldest male* runners were 83 years old.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(aes(x = Age, fill =M.F), data = marathon_2017) +
geom_histogram(position = position_dodge()) +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(marathon_2017$Age), max(marathon_2017$Age),by = 5),10)) +
scale_colour_wsj() + theme_wsj()+
labs(title='Age and Gender of Runners')
```

It seemes women are more eager to marathon when they are younger,specially when they are *25* and again when they are around *40*,but as they becoe older,they lose eagerness to run,but in reverse men become interested to marathon slow by slow when they become older,specifically when they become *40,45,50* they love to join marathon races.after turning to *50* always more number of men are interested to run compare to women.

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=Gender, y=Age, fill=M.F), data = marathon_2017) +
geom_boxplot() +
theme_economist()+ scale_color_economist() +theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold", color = "tomato", hjust = 0.5))+
labs(title=' Boxplot of Runners by Age and Gender')

```

Intersting point in this plot is *Female runnersare younger than male runners* in first quartile, median and third quartile.Median for women is at their 40 but for men is at their *45*.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
marathon_2017 %>%
mutate(Official_Time=lubridate::hms(Official.Time)) %>%
mutate(New_time = lubridate::period_to_seconds(Official_Time)) %>% 
group_by(M.F) %>%
summarize(Ave_Time=mean(New_time, na.rm=T),Ave_Age=mean(Age,na.rm=T),.group="drop")

```
It could be seen *Average time* of finishing the race for women is more than men,also the women who end the race are younger compare to men.


New variable is defined as *New_time* to have finishing time of all the runners in seconds for easier analysis:
```{r}
New_marathon <- marathon_2017 %>% 
mutate(official_time = lubridate::hms(Official.Time)) %>% 
mutate(New_time = lubridate::period_to_seconds(official_time)) %>% 
select(Age, M.F, official_time, New_time, everything())
```

```{r}
New_marathon %>% 
group_by(M.F, Age) %>% 
summarize(ave_time = mean(New_time, na.rm = T), 
ave_age = mean(Age, na.rm = T),
.groups = "drop")
```

```{r}
library(plotly)
New_marathon %>% 
group_by(M.F, Age) %>% 
summarize(ave_time = mean(New_time, na.rm = T), 
ave_age = mean(Age, na.rm = T),.groups = "drop") %>% 
ggplot() + 
geom_point(aes(x = Age, y = ave_time, color = M.F))+labs(title="Trend of Average Finishing Time VS. Age and Gender")+theme(legend.position = "bottom")+theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold",color = "tomato"))
ggplotly()
```

This plot shows that if we like or dislike , **age**is really important!
As you see when people are between *20 to 40* years old average finishing time is much less compare to when they become older.
Second interesting point is that usually in all periods of life men finish a marathon race sooner than women.Specially when they are so old *(after 70 years old)* men run more faster than women.

```{r}
New_marathon %>% 
group_by(M.F, Age) %>% 
summarize(ave_time = mean(New_time, na.rm = T), 
ave_age = mean(Age, na.rm = T),
.groups = "drop") %>% 
ggplot() + 
geom_density(aes(x = ave_time,color = M.F))+labs(title=" Average Finishing Time of Runners")+theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold",color = "tomato"))
ggplotly()
```

Again we see there is a *gender gap* between male and female. on average male run faster than female. 
This gap is greater among the runners who finish sooner than among those who finish last.
The peak finish time for male crossed finished line was in *13237 sec*  and *14825 sec* for female.  

```{r}
New_marathon <- marathon_2017 %>% 
mutate(official_time = lubridate::hms(Official.Time)) %>% 
mutate(New_time = lubridate::period_to_seconds(official_time)) %>% 
select(Age, M.F, official_time, New_time, everything())
```

```{r}
Runners<-New_marathon %>%
filter(Country=="JPN"|Country=="CAN"|Country=="ITA")
view(Runners)
```

With above commands we filter only *3* countries of *Japan,Canada,Italy* to analyse them in more detailes.

```{r}
ggplot(data=Runners,mapping=aes(x=New_time,fill=M.F))+
geom_histogram(color = "darkorchid4")+labs(title="Gender distrubution in Different finishing Times for Specific 3 countries",subtitle="Japan,Italy,Canada")+scale_color_brewer(palette = "Pastel2")
ggplotly()
```
For only *3* selected country from 3 different continent,I checked gender distrubition in different finishing times,most of the men run in *12800 seconds* while most of the women run in *13400 seconds*.

```{r}
#Filter fast runners who finish game in less than *9000 seconds*
Runners<-New_marathon %>%
filter(New_time<9000)
view(Runners)
```


```{r}
library(ggrepel)
```


```{r}
ggplot(data=Runners,mapping=aes(x=New_time,y=Age,color=M.F)) + 
geom_point()+geom_line()+
xlab('Finish Time(sec)') +scale_color_fivethirtyeight()+
labs(title='Fast Runners Finishing Time')+geom_label_repel(aes(label = Overall))+theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold",color = "tomato"))
```
This plot shows *overall rank* of a runner with its *gender* in finishing time of less than *9000* seconds*.
First one is a male who finishes in 7750 seconds and the first fast female runner finishes at *8600* seconds and her rank is *21th*.

```{r}
filter(New_marathon, M.F == "M",Country=="USA") %>%
mutate(Half_time =lubridate::hms(X10K)) %>% 
mutate(New_Halftime =lubridate::period_to_seconds(Half_time)) %>%  
mutate(official_time = lubridate::hms(Official.Time)) %>% 
mutate(New_time = lubridate::period_to_seconds(official_time)) %>%   
ggplot(aes(x=New_time, y=New_Halftime, rm.na=T)) +
geom_point(aes(colour = Country)) + 
geom_smooth(method='lm')+labs(title="Correlation of Halfway and Finishing Time",subtitle="USA")+coord_cartesian(xlim = c(7000, 25000),ylim = c (2000, 6000) )+
annotate(geom = "text",x = 15000, y = 4000,label = "Highly Correlated!")+theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold",color = "tomato"))+xlab('Finish Time(sec)')+ylab("halftime(sec)")
```
There is a *correlation* between finishing time and half time finishing in **USA**.


```{r}
New_marathon1<-New_marathon %>% 
mutate(Half_time =lubridate::hms(X10K)) %>% 
mutate(New_Halftime =lubridate::period_to_seconds(Half_time)) %>%  
mutate(official_time = lubridate::hms(Official.Time)) %>% 
mutate(New_time = lubridate::period_to_seconds(official_time)) 
head(New_marathon1)
```

There is a high correlation of 0.903 between finishing time and halfway time in USA for maraton runners.As hifhway time increases so does finishing time.


```{r}
library(ggrepel)
filter(New_marathon,Overall<=20)%>% 
mutate(official_time = lubridate::hms(Official.Time)) %>% 
mutate(New_time = lubridate::period_to_seconds(official_time)) %>%     
ggplot(fill="red")+theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold",color = "tomato"))+
geom_col(aes(x = Overall,y= New_time,color="red"))+labs(title="Finishing Time of 20 First Runners")+xlab("Overall Rank")+ylab("Finishing Time")
ggplotly()
```

Filtering the first *20* runners,then plot overall ranks of them versus finishing time.First runners finish it in *7777 seconds*,second one in 20 seconds later. The last one in *8418 seconds*,so they really finish the race in a very close range.


```{r}
New_marathon %>%
filter(Age<=25) %>%
ggplot(aes(x=Country,colour = Country,rm.na=T)) +
geom_bar(fill="pink") + 
labs(title="Countries with youngest runners",xaxis ="Number of runners", yaxis = "Country")+theme(axis.text.x =element_text(angle=65,vjust=0.6))+coord_flip()+theme_void()
ggplotly()
```
Above plot shows countries which have youngest runnersunder *25* years old,as it is obvious USA with *1666* young runners has the most youngest runners among other countries. with a huge difference canada is the second country with *43* young runners under 25 years old.

# conclusion
I chose this dataset because when I was studying my bachelor I joind marathon group of my previous university and I had a memorable time those days.So his dataset could decode some new aspects of this sport for me in other countries.
I started ploting some basic plot at first to have a general opinion about the whole topic,then shifted to some interactive plot and finally some spatial plot.bellow you can find some interesting issues which I found from these plot:

* The *youngest female* finishers were **18** years old, and *oldest female* ones were **84** years old.

* *youngest male* finishers were 18 years old and *oldest male* runners were **83** years old.

* Women are more eager to marathon when they are younger,specially when they are **25** and again when they are around **40**,but as they becoe older,they lose eagerness to run.

* Men become interested to marathon slow by slow when they become older,specifically when they become **40,45,50** they love to join marathon races.after turning to **50** always more number of men are interested to run compare to women.

* *Female runnersare younger than male runners* in first quartile, median and third quartile.Median for women is at their **40** but for men is at their **45**.

* Average time of finishing the race for women is more than men,also the women who end the race are younger compare to men.

* Age is really important!as you see when people are between **20 to 40** years old average finishing time is much less compare to when they become older.

* Men finish  marathon race sooner than women.Specially when they are so old (after 70 years old) men run more faster than women.

* There is a *gender gap* between male and female. On average male run faster than female. This gap is greater among the runners who finish sooner than among those who finish last.

* The peak finish time for male crossed finished line was in **13237** sec  and **14825** sec for female.

* For only 3 selected country **(Japan,Canada,Italy)** from 3 different continent,gender distrubition in different finishing times,most of the men run in 12800 seconds while most of the women run in 13400 seconds.

* For finishing time of less than **9000** seconds,First one is a male who finishes in **7750** seconds and the first fast female runner finishes at **8600** seconds and her rank is 21th.

* There is a high correlation of *0.903* between finishing time and halfway time in USA for maraton runners.As halfhway time increases so does finishing time.

* Filtering the first **20** runners,first runners finish it in **7777** seconds,second one in *20* seconds later. The last one in **8418** seconds,so they really finish the race in a very close range.

* In countries which have youngest runnersunder **25** years old,as it is obvious USA with **1666** young runners has the most youngest runners among other countries. with a huge difference canada is the second country with **43** young runners under 25 years old.

* Calculating the number of participants in every country (using count function) shows that *USA* has the first rank of participants with **20945** runners with huge difference even with the second country which *Canada* with *1870*.
Some countries only had **1** participant such as *Falkland Islands*,*Bulgaria* and *Jamaica*.

* 3 first countries with most poplution of runneres are shown in one of spetial map:*USA with 20945,Canada with 1870 and *United Kingdom with 425*paticipants were most active countries in this sport at *2017*.


* Then Young Faster Runners Population in every country was checked and again *USA* with **66** runners under **40** was the first ranked country.

* After filltering the male runners to check the gender balance of this race,it shows that for countries such as  *USA* and *Canada* there is a fair gender balance.

* Finally I was really curious to know how is the trend of old women(more than 50s) in participating in marathon sport,and it was intersting to see this distrubution in different countries,again *USA* with **1887** female participants has the first ranking of this category.



# Principles of data visualization:

## Geometrics:

Different type of plots were created including:histogram,scatterplot,coloumn bar,density,box plot to visualize different aspects of this dataset.

## Design:

* Gestalt Principles tried to be considered specially items such as proximity,similarity,continuty and closure.

* The Big Four: CRAP

 1. Contrast*: make different by different fonts and color.

 2. Repetition*:Repeat visual elements (colors, fonts, shapes) to create a strong unified theme.

 3. Alignment*: try to have a visual connection among items in the plots

 4. Proximity*: group related items


## Aesthetics: 

* Using some functions such as *theme() function* with installing *ggthemes* package to create different type of theme for every plot.

* Customizing the look with *coord_cartesian* and defining x and y limit for our plot.Flipping the axis with *coord_flip()* and *geom_label_repel* to add label to plot.Finally I used  *annotation* to add specific point of the chart when was useful.
* Dodging preserves the vertical position of an geom while adjusting the horizontal position. *position_dodge()* requires the grouping variable to be be specified in the geom.
* *scale_x_continuous* is a tool for scales of having continuous x axis aesthetics.*breaks* is an integer guiding the number of major breaks on the x axis.
* modify the title of graphs with *plot.title* function and using face and size to modify format of title.Also modify tilte location with *hjust*

## Color Palettes: 

* Using some different color pallet to emphasize on important sections and results.

* I tried to use *bright or dark colors* to highlight information that requires greater attention.in this dataset there was a unordered categorical *(gender)* required distinct colors that will not be easily confused with one another.

* Moreover, whenever I needed a special color a *Hexadecimal* color was used.



## Interactive Map:

I really like these type of map,tried to have the function of  *ggplotly()* for most of the plot,as it gives me really a better perceive of data in detail.Also you can zoom by selecting an area of interest and hover the line to get exact value of an area.


## Spatial Map:

*  Drawing spetial plot was challenging for me at first and I got many guidance from Dr.Sanchez,but after being able to a variety of plots their interpretation was interesting for me, also as abbraviation of countries names were avialable,package of *rnaturalearth* was used and by using function of *leftjoin* dataframe of *marathon_2017* and datashape of *world* were joined to eachother.
