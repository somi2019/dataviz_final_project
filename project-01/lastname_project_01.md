## Mini-Project 1

This data set includes the information on the FIFA Worldcup Matches from 1930 to 2014 as well as the players with the number of goals conceded by each team. Using this data in a tidy format we would like to analyze the trends of these matches.

_Which variables are used more in this analyiys?_ 

In this mini project mailnly it was focoused on some specific variables despite the data set has 20 variables.  mostly analyzed a limited number of them such as *audience,City,home team goals,away team goals*.
also some new variables were created to extend analysis report such as *total goals,winning team,sec half goals*.
one of my favorite charts is the bellow one:
